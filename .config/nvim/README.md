## Command cheat sheet

## Common Issues

#### Debug breakpoint shows letter R

This usually means that the path to the current directory is incorrect ie `develper/competitive-programming` instead of `Developer/competitive-programming`.
In this instance the case is important.

#### LSP support is broken for latest language version

For example: updating to Go version 1.22 broke LSP support. To fix this, you need to update the LSP server. To do this,
run the below command:

```
:Mason
```

Then run `U` to update mason packages.
