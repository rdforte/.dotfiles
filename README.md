## Getting Started

Follow the below setup. This will enable us to easily manage our dotfiles using git. For example once setup we can run git commands as such `dotfiles status`, `dotfiles add <file>`, `dotfiles commit`.

```
git clone --bare https://github.com/rdforte/.dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
dotfiles checkout
```

If you already have some of the dotfiles present, you will see a similar error.

```
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
 .bashrc
Please move or remove them before you switch branches.
Aborting
```

Remove or backup any collisions and repeat the checkout.
